## Abstract

Developing an effective strategy for screening predicted antibody-antigen complexes structures generated by rigid-body docking represents a crucial step toward accurate complex structure prediction, for understanding the physicochemical determinants of antibody-antigen recognition, and for increasing the success rate of in silico therapeutics development. This work aims to develop a novel type of knowledge-based scoring function - also referred to as a knowledge-based statistical potential. These functions, derived from the statistical analysis of intermolecular contacts in experimentally resolved structures, infer general properties that are chemically favorable and - being present in native structures - retained by evolution. Consequently, such functions quantify the likelihood of pairwise amino acid interactions based on biological data and may be utilized to screen out docking poses whose contacts are far from likely to occur. While scoring protocols based on symmetric statistical potentials are widely employed for evaluating general protein-protein docking poses, asymmetric statistical potentials have been shown to more effectively capture the inherent asymmetry that characterizes antibody-antigen interfaces. However, existing methods evaluate statistical potentials over the entire binding interface, thereby averaging the residue composition heterogeneity across the full interacting surfaces. To address this limitation, this work introduces an innovative methodology for computing radially distributed symmetric and asymmetric statistical potentials, based on the theoretical framework of stratified sampling. By explicitly capturing the radial variation in amino acid composition, this strategy aims to generate an improved scoring function that accounts for the subtle compositional gradients within the interface, thereby enhancing the discrimination between near-native and decoy poses compared to traditional whole-interface approaches when applied to AlphaFold 3 docking predictions.
