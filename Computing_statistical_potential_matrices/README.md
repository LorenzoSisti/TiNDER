# Computing statistical potential matrices

This folder contains the script necessary to compute whole-interface and radially distributed symmetric and asymmetric pairwise statistical potentials from the antibody-antigen complexes representative collection, and the scripts to assign to each predicted complex the corresponding statistical potential value.

`Computing_whole_interface_statistical_potentials_from_pdb_set` allows you to compute whole-interface CG statistical potentials from a set of PDB files fast (parallelization).
